### Taking over the Admin panel of an Laravel application.

Laravel based application containing the challenge of taking over Admin Panel (docker image & documentation will be available at: https://pentestlabs.gitbook.io/challenges/admin-panel-takeover-i)

The Django Application was cloned from **TraversyMedia's GitHub page** & was modified later since I'm too lazy to write something from scratch.

You can find me [@syed__umar](https://twitter.com/syed__umar) and the challenges @ [PentestLabs](https://pentestlabs.gitbook.io/challenges/). The challenge was inspired by [OWASP SKF](https://owasp-skf.gitbook.io/) and I'll be creating more like these in the near future, stay tuned! 

#### Usage:
```bash
docker run -it --rm uexpl0it/admin-panel-takeover:latest /bin/bash -c 'chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh'
```
